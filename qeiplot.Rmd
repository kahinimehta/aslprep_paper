Read the data in
1. the data has many datasets (eg PNC). The aim is to show relationship bewteen QEI and FD. 
We are also interested in interection of CBFTTYPE with FD. 


```{r}
datax = read.csv('~/Documents/aslprep_paper/gmdata2.csv')
head(datax)
unique(datax$CBFTYPE)
```
```{r}
pnc <- subset(datax, Datasets=='PNC')

# is this smodel correct?
pnc.model <- lmerTest::lmer(QEI ~ CBFTYPE + FD + CBFTYPE*FD  + (1 | sub ), data=pnc)

summary(pnc.model)

```

There are 4 unique CBFTYPE ( "SCBF"  "SCRUB" "BASIL" "PVC"), but only 3 is shown in the result
BASIL is missing.
What do we report to show significant of the CBFTYPE interaction with FD
